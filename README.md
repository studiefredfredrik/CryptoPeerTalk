# About
Crypto Peer Talk, CPT for short is a
chat application that uses the Diffie Hellman
key exchange to establish a secure encrypted 
connection that lets you talk in full privacy.

CPT uses UDP packets and is strictly peer to peer,
there is no servers involved, no registration and
no third party with access to your data.

There is no user accounts, you simply connect IP
to IP, you can store the IP addresses you use
often along with a name tag in the contact list.
